# Fast FFT-Based Biharmonic Solver

This short MATLAB code solves the biharmonic equation with free space boundary conditions with spectral accuracy, only using FFTs, as described in F. Vico, L. Greengard, and M. Ferrando, ``Fast convolution with free-space Green's functions", Journal of Computational Physics 323, 191 (2016)
